# Connectis-task

Assignment and Instructions:
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for
each customer per month and total.
Checklist
a. Goal of the assignment: showcase great craftsmanship in area of REACT JS. Solution should be
designed in a way that shows healthy architecture (solutions with 2-3 files will not be accepted).
Solution should show the data flow and good practices in working with backend from the UI
perspective
b. Time required: anywhere between 3-6h depending on proficiency
c. Technical guidelines:
i. Can use https://create-react-app.dev/ to get started quickly
ii. avoid additional frameworks and Typescript – only REACT JS
iii. Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution (can use tools to generate data or
manually create some data)
iv. Check solution into GitHub and share the URL(Make it Public)
v. Plan your code composition structure (e.g separate service to simulate API request,
separate file to calculate points, split UI into few readable files, etc.)
vi. No hardcoded / magic numbers. Use constant definitions/dynamic props
vii. Code should be clean, nicely formatted, easy to read and understand and follow best
practices
viii. UI needs to be reasonably OK. Not expecting a fancy UI.
ix. No errors or warnings in runtime
x. Code must compile and run, there should be an instruction in README.md file how to
run the application.
xi. Nice to have: unit tests
xii. Nice to have: error handling after loading application
xiii. Nice to have: handling of data loading – e.g. spinner
